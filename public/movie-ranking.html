<h1>The Best Movies According to James!</h1>
<h2>These are my all time favourite movies. Or films. Depending on what your flavour is.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Back to the Future</h3>
<p>Funny, clever, thrilling, heavy. Quite frankly the most perfect film.</p>
<h3>2. Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Very charming and very sweet. Ghibli at its very best. <b>(Yes, I am aware that it is <i>everyone's</i> favourite Ghibli film but this is my house and it is my rules.)</b></p>
<h3>3. Shaun of the Dead</h3>
<p>How can one film have so many quotable lines? Only Edgar Wright can.</p>
